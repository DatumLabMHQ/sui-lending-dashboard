# State of Lending on Sui

Every lending pool and CDP vault on Sui across NAVI, Suilend, Scallop, AlphaLend and Bucket, with liquidations and protocol TVL, built on the Datum data platform.

Built with [datum-databuild-kit](https://github.com/DatumLabMHQ/datum-databuild-kit). Every number comes from the
Datum data platform through datum-api; this app holds no data and runs no crons. Without `DATUM_API_KEY` it runs
on labelled sample data.

- `datum.config.ts`: title, the question the overview answers, resources and their column mapping, nav, sources, definitions.
- `lib/data.ts`: turns resources into the normalised shapes in `lib/types.ts` (or returns `lib/sample.ts`).
- `lib/datum.ts`: the server-side platform client. `lib/format.ts`: the formatters every number goes through.
- `app/(app)/`: the shared frame (shadcn dashboard-01 block), the pages (overview, markets, one market, methodology, the chart guide) and a loading skeleton per route.
- `components/`: app-sidebar, site-header, command-menu, status-banner, page-header, page-breadcrumb, section-cards, chart-area-interactive, data-table, asset-avatar, market-charts, market-facts, market-detail-layout, site-footer, ThemeToggle; `components/charts/` is the chart library; `components/ui/` is shadcn on Phosphor icons.
- Design rules: `docs/DESIGN.md` in the kit; chart rules: `docs/CHARTS.md`.

```bash
npm install && npm run dev            # sample data
npm run dev:platform                   # the platform, key read from ~/.config/datum/.env
npm run check                          # typecheck, lint and build, before a PR
```

Deploy: `vercel link --scope datumlabs1 --project sui-lending-dashboard`, add `DATUM_API_URL` and `DATUM_API_KEY`, push to main.
